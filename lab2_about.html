<h2>About this page</h2>
<section id="Biography"> <h3>Biography<h3> 
<p> My name is Isabella Mankis. I am from Bellevue, Washington. I currently attend Bellevue College as a Digital Marketing student. I find environmental issues to be something of importance and to be taken seriously.</p></section>
<section id="topic_importance"><h3>Why the Amazon Rainforest?</h3>
<p>I have always found environmental issues to be something people know about and  care about, but never acted on because some people don't realize the impact of these different environmental issues. 
Without trees, we won't have enough oxygen to survive on the planet. Therefore it is of the upmost importance to be preserving the rainforest. 
The United States alone has chopped down more trees than can be replanted. Is the Amazon Rainforest really worth our ability to breathe?  </p></section>
