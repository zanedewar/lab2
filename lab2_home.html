<section id="deforestation_information"><h2>What's with deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest?</h2>
<p>Deforestation is the action of tearing down trees and clearing land either for the purpose of using the wood of the trees or using the land that the trees are on.
With the Amzaon Rainforest, it's unfortunate that deforestation is happening rapidly for both reasons and at the same time, neither.</p>
<p>Currently, people in the Amazon are tearing down the trees for agricultural purposes such as planting crops or using the land for cattle.
Unfortunately, the Amazon soil is not nutrient rich because the trees have evolved over time to absorb any nutrients in the land.</p>
<p>The way farmers go about solving this problem is by burning the wood from the trees and the excess ash is used for nutrients.
This is a very backwards thinking process because the majority of nutrients are burned with the wood, the nutrients leftover in the ash are only viable for a short time, and the land is then deemed worthless after only a short time.</p>
<p>With this rapid turnover of land, the Amazon rainforest is predicted to be half of it's size by the year 2030.
This is absolutely terrifying because the Amazon rainforest is the biggest collection of trees, and with that the trees are incredible in size.
<p>With that amount of deforestation, the atmosphere will see a huge shift in carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>If the Amazon was simply cut down, the trees were chopped up and used for nutrients in place of burning the trees for the ashes, and the deforestation rate was slowed down by 10 years, there would still be cause for concern.
The surrounding rivers and streams are filled with animals and algae that respire carbon dioxide. This means that it isn't just humans that are dependent on the trees converting the carbon dioxide to oxygen.
As farmers and other agriculturalists are burning these trees, they are emmiting even more carbon into the atmosphere and, eventually, the rainforest will reach a point where there are not enough trees to consume the amounts of carbon in the air.</p></section>
<section id="how_to_help"><h2>How you can help</h2>
<p> This can be very overwhelming to think of and some people may think that there is nothing they can do. This is not true at all and there are ways to help at home.</p>
<h3>Holding businesses accountable</h3>
<p>The reason I have put this as the top thing to do at home is because businesses are not just serving one person. Many businesses are serving millions of people across the world. 
When companies and businesses are held responsible for their actions, they then have to make changes that fit the needs and wants of the consumer which in this case would be finding an alternative to wood and paper products.</p>
<h3>Reduce consumption of oil</h3>
<p>This may be something you don't think of very often but it's incredibly important. Burning of gasses, oil, and carbon have massive effects on the environment and are rapidly changing our climate.
With the amount of stress this puts on the environment, we will see rapid declines around the world of natural resource survival rates and eventually life on the planet will begin to fade, starting with humanity.</p>
<h3>Reducing beef consumption</h3>
<p>As I said before, one of the main reasons for deforestation in the amazon is the use of the land for agricultural purposes. 
This is mainly for cattle. There has been a huge increase of need for cattle in the past few years that has had a detrimental impact on the environment.
Unfortunately, cattle is actually one of the biggest producers of carbon and is only adding to the worsening of our atmosphere. This is yet another category of animal that respires carbon.
That mixed with the carbon in the waste produced by these animals makes the job of the rainforest that much harder.</p>
<h3>Reducing consumption of wood and paper</h3>
<p>Obviously the chopping down of trees initially had one primary purpose, using the wood. We use wood and paper products alot more than we think. 
Reducing the consumption of these products will help aid the efforts to stop deforestation. If there is less of a need for wood and paper, why would we need to cut down trees?</p>
